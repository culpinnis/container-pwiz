    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If you are a consumer, this does
    not apply if legal provisions, in particular consumer protection legislation,
    conflict with this choice. The courts of Bremen shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction. If you are not a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a
    public-law special fund in the sense Section 38 of the German Code of Civil
    Procedure (ZPO), the <span class="GramE">agreement on the place of jurisdiction
    is replaced by the legal provisions</span>.</span></p>
